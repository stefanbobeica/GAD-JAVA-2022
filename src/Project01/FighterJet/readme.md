In this example I have used the Decorator Design Pattern. 
In the real world a fighter jet can have various functionalities(reconnaisance, air superiority etc) and it can have one or more of these utilities. 
Basically you have a default fighter jet, and then you "decorate" it with the functionality/functionalities that you want it to serve.
