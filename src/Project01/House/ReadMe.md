I have used the Builder Design Pattern. 
Houses are very different from many points of view(some have a pool, other have a garden etc) but they also share some specifications( each house has a bedroom, bathroom or a kitchen).
Since some of the differentiators are not mandatory for a house I opted for the Builder Design Pattern, that way  I did not have to specify the unused things of a house when instantiating the House class.
